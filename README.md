# Hello-World
Hello-World GitHub tutorial. Ignore.
I have completed the 5-minute (or less) course for the Python Syntax at Codecademy.com.
I have no prior experience in coding, though I learned some B.A.S.I.C in 10th grade which I have completely forgotten about now.
I am proud to have successfully written about 10 lines in the windows command prompt (copying(not copy-pasting) lines from internet).
In Karachi, Pakistan most jobs require front-end/back-end web development and designing, and I have no knowledge of how to do that.
